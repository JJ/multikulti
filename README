This is the first release of the multikulti algorithm, and made mainly
for support of the papers we're submitting to several journals and
conferences. This means that you're basically on your own if you want
to use it. However, here are some guidelines to compile
* You need to install PVM3, preferably in /usr/share/pvm3 (the
directory the Makefile refers to)
* It should work with current versions of gnu C++. If it does not,
please let us know.

Basically, you're done downloading it, unpacking it, and issuing
make. Good luck!
